.TH TIMEOUTS 5
.SH NAME
timeouts \- user login/idle/session time limits
.SH DESCRIPTION
The timeouts file is used by timeoutd (8) to impose limits on what times
particular users or groups of users can login on particular
terminals, how long a user can be idle (no activity on the terminal),
how long a user can be logged in for in a single session and how much
time a user can spend on a set of terminals each day.
.PP
The timeouts file is a plain ASCII file.  Blank lines, or lines where
the first non blank character is a hash (#) will be ignored.  All other
lines should be of the format:
.PP
TIMES:TTYS:USERS:GROUPS:MAXIDLE[;MESSAGE]:MAXSESS[;MESSAGE]:MAXDAY[;MESSAGE]:WARN:LOCKOUT[;MESSAGE]
.PP
OR
.PP
TIMES:TTYS:USERS:GROUPS:LOGINSTATUS[;MESSAGE]
.PP
\fBTIMES\fR is a comma separated list of times for which the entry is valid.
The entry will be ignored completely outside these times.
The format for each element of the times field is: DD[DD...][SSSS-EEEE]
Where:
.IP
DD is one of Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Wk Al
.br
(Al = SuMoTuWeThFrSa  Wk = MoTuWeThFr)
.IP
SSSS and EEEE are start and end times in 24 hour notation.
.PP
\fBTTYS\fR is a comma separated list of ttys (without the leading /dev/)
for which the entry is valid.  A trailing asterisk (*) will result in
any tty which matches up to the asterisk being accepted.  An asterisk
by itself matches all ttys.
.PP
\fBUSERS\fR is a comma separated list of users, with pattern matching
as for TTYS.
.PP
\fBGROUPS\fR is a comma separated list of groups, with pattern matching
as for TTYS.
.PP
\fBMAXIDLE\fR is the number of minutes which a user may remain idle
without being logged off.  Idle time is defined as time during which
no activity (no output to the tty or input from the tty) is detected.
This is not checked under Linux if the tty is in SLIP mode.
.PP
\fBMAXSESS\fR is the maximum number of minutes that a user
can be logged in for in a single session if they match that entry.
.PP
\fBMAXDAY\fR is the maximum number of minutes per day that a user
can be logged in for if they match that entry.
.PP
\fBWARN\fR provides a facility for notifying a user that they are
about to be logged off due to exceeding MAXSESS or MAXDAY.  WARN is
measured in minutes with a default value of 5.  The user will receive
a warning every minute for WARN minutes before being logged off.
.PP
\fBLOCKOUT\fR is the number of minutes that must elapse after a
(MAXSESS - WARN) length session before a user can login again.
.PP
\fBLOGINSTATUS\fR is one of either LOGIN or NOLOGIN and is used to
limit the times during which certain people or groups of people can
use specific terminals.
.PP
When searching through the timeouts file, timeoutd will use the first
entry for which the TIMES:TTYS:USERS:GROUPS fields all match the
user who is being checked.
.PP
When calculating the number of minutes for which a user has been logged
on in the given day, timeoutd will consider logged in time on all
ttys covered by the TTYS field for the matching entry.
.PP
.SH MESSAGES
The MAXIDLE, MAXSESSION, MAXDAY, LOCKOUT and NOLOGIN fields can
optionally be follwed by semicolon and a string which provides a
custom message to be used in the event of that limit being
exceeded. The string can be either the message itself or a fully
qualified path to a file containing the text required.
.BR
If these are not specified, built-in defaults are used.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP Al:*:*:*:10;/etc/timeoutd/messages/idle
Would match all all users in any group regardless of which tty they
are logged in on and allow an idle time of 10 minutes, with no daily
or session time limits. A custom message would be used from the file
specified to inform the user what is happening.
.IP SaSu:ttyS*:*:subs:5:90:180:3
Would match all users in group subs logged on to any dialin line (assuming
all serial lines are dialins) over the weekend and allow them 5 minutes
idle time, 90 minutes per session and 180 minutes per day, with a 3
minute warning period before logoff will occur.
.IP Wk:ttyS2,ttyS4:*:subs,other:10::60:5
Would match all users in groups subs or other logged on to ttyS2 or ttyS4
on a weekday
and allow them 10 minutes idle time, no session limit and a 60 minute
daily limit with a 5 minute warning period.  Note that this provides
for 60 minutes per day across both ttyS2 and ttyS4, NOT 60 minutes on ttyS2
and 60 minutes on ttyS4.
.IP Wk2000-0700:ttyS*:*:*:NOLOGIN
Would match all dialled in users (if all ttyS lines were modems) and
prevent them logging in before 7am or after 8pm on weekdays.
